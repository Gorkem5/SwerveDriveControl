# SwerveDriveControl
This project implements swerve drive for a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) robot using WPILib and Java. Swerve drive offers an unrivaled level of maneuverability and precision as each wheel can operate separately. Field-oriented control is also supported since many motors may have arbitrary orientations, and PID controllers are employed to guarantee smooth and accurate motor control.

This code is highly adaptable to different hardware configurations and is intended for advanced robotics applications. It needs the tuning of components such as encoders and gyroscopes for optimal performance. This is perfect for teams looking to maximize swerve drive and make the most of the swerve drive technology available to competitive robotics
